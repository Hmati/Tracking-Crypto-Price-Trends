# Tracking-Crypto-Price-Trends

Advanced Data Engineering and Analytics Project: Tracking Crypto Price Trends and Analyzing 
Live Trading Activity on Crypto Exchanges Using Python (or Scala) and Apache Kafka..Leverage the Coinbase
 API to retrieve various cryptocurrency prices. Use Apache Kafka to calculate moving average prices and store
 the data in a time-series database for further analysis.Tracking and giving insights on a coin
 before it's listed on Binance or Coinbase.
 
 A roadmap to  structure this project:

---

### **1. Project Overview**
This project involves:
- Retrieving cryptocurrency price data using the **Coinbase API**.
- Streaming live data with **Apache Kafka**.
- Performing real-time analytics, like calculating **moving averages**.
- Storing the processed data in a **time-series database** (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
- Analyzing trends and gaining insights on coins before listing on major exchanges.

---

### **2. Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Languages**: Python or Scala.
- **Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka.
- **Database**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension.
- **APIs**: Coinbase API (for cryptocurrency data).
- **Visualization**: Grafana for visualizing trends.

### **3. Steps to Implement**

#### **Step 1: Set up the Environment**
1. Install **Apache Kafka** on your local machine or set up a managed Kafka service like Confluent Cloud.
2. Set up a time-series database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB).
3. Install necessary libraries for Python:
   - `pandas`, `requests`, `kafka-python`, `sqlalchemy`, `numpy`.

#### **Step 2: Retrieve Crypto Data**
1. Register for the **Coinbase API** and obtain your API key.
2. Write a script to retrieve live cryptocurrency prices:


#### **Step 3: Stream Data with Apache Kafka**
1. Create a Kafka producer to send the retrieved price data to a Kafka topic:
   
2. Set up a Kafka consumer to process the data:

#### **Step 4: Calculate Moving Averages**
1. Use a sliding window mechanism to calculate moving averages in real time:
   

#### **Step 5: Store Data in a Time-Series Database**
1. Write the processed data to a database (e.g., TimescaleDB):
   

#### **Step 6: Visualize the Data**
1. Use **Grafana** to create dashboards for:
   - Price trends.
   - Moving average comparisons.
   - Volume spikes for potential pre-listing coins.

#### **Step 7: Insights on Pre-Listing Coins**
1. Create a data pipeline to track social media mentions, developer activity (GitHub), and trading volumes.
2. Use natural language processing or sentiment analysis to analyze market hype.

---

### **4. Final Deliverables**
1. **Code Repository**: Publish your code and documentation on GitHub.
2. **Presentation/Report**: Summarize your findings and insights.
3. **Live Dashboard**: Share your Grafana dashboards for dynamic monitoring.
